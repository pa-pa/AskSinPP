supports: 
* trailing-edge phase cut dimming (as on original hardware)![](https://github.com/SCUBA82/AskSinPP/blob/master/examples/custom/HB-LC-Dim1TPBU-FM/Images/K800_trailing-edge-cut.JPG)
* leading-edge phase cut dimming (not as clean as trailing-edge phase cut) ![](https://github.com/SCUBA82/AskSinPP/blob/master/examples/custom/HB-LC-Dim1TPBU-FM/Images/K800_leading-edge-cut.JPG)
* temperature monitoring
* shutdown through overload detection
* both buttons as remote
